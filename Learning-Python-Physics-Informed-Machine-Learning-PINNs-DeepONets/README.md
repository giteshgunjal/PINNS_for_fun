# Learning-PIML-in-Python

Hi, Iâ€™m Juan Diego Toscano. Thanks for stopping by.

This repository will help you to get involved in the physics-informed machine learning world. In particular, it includes several step-by-step guides on the basic concepts required to run and understand  Physics-informed Machine Learning models (from approximating functions, solving and discovering ODE/PDEs with PINNs,  to solving parametric PDEs with DeepONets). 

I reviewed some of these problems in my Youtube channel, so please watch them if you have time.

PI-DeepONets Youtube Tutorial:https://youtu.be/YpNYVD9B_Js

Also, if you are interested and PINNs and Machine Learning, please consider subscribing to the Crunch Group (Brown University) Youtube channel. They upload weekly seminars on Scientific Machine Learning.
